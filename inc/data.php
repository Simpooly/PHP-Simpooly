Beside each book is a section to describe the basic concepts of each album. I implemented a hover feature that added a box shadow, transitioned and increased the size of each photo when a cursor glides over it. If you click on the available area it will link you to the Barns and Noble online bookstore to purchase his products. ",

The gallery is formatted using flexbox, and will transition to one per line when on a smaller viewport or mobile device.",

Design and layout break easily if I'm not careful.",
