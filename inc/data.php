As my first real project, it was interesting to find that knowing the documentation and making it work together were two completely different things. I struggled getting the images of the books to link properly. In the end I found it was not my code, but the URL.",

In my process of being excited about my speed, my lack of organization was my downfall. It taught me how important it was to label and know where things were, and how much design and layout can break if I'm not careful.",

I was overwhelmed with all the different API's out there, some gave a list of quotes others automatically generated them. Learning the process of acquiring the keys and using them correctly in a query took the most time. Once I had the data selecting the correct information was the downhill slide.",

They didnt want API keys in CodePen for security and privacy reasons. I got the majority of the project and found out that database did not provide all the information required (ie. city, state). Using a different database such as google maps would have provided more information than just the longitude and latitude.",
