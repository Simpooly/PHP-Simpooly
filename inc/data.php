      "goal" => "The purpose of this project was tp practice HTML and CSS basics, This is the first project where both languages were used together.",

      "troubles" => "I had spent many weeeks learning the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, JQuery and more. As my first real project it was intersting to find that knowing the different parts and making the different parts work together were two completely different things. I struggled getting the images of the books to link properly. I was doing what the documantation was telling me to, but it still wasnt working. In the end I found out it was not my code, but the URL. I found that Barns & Noble had a more helpful url to link to and used that instead.",

      "outcome" => "I learned a lot on this first simple project. Experimentation and trial and error is a must. Being a perfectionist is both a great strength and a hinderance. Problem solve more instead of getting stuck on the problem.",

Then the process if actually getting the key and putting it in propery.",

      "troubles" => "With this project i have learned that finding a good database is important. I used the database that FreeCodeCamp provided because they didnt want API keys in codeCamp for protection/ privacy. I got most of the way through the project and found out that database did not provide the name of the sity or state, just the longitude and latitude, what i have alreay had. It was not a requirement to have what city you were located, but i would have to foind a different database, to just generate that one piece of info. ",

      "outcome" => "In the futuure I will learn to find a database that has all or most of the info i need to reduce needing to connect with multiple places. Efficancy is a goal I have in all work I do, it makes things simple and eventually easier, even if the process leading up to that is a little messy",
