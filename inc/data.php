As my first real project it was intersting to find that knowing the different parts and making the different parts work were two completely different things. I struggled getting the images of the books to link properly. I was doing what the documantation was telling me to, but it still wasnt working. In the end i found out it was not my code, but the URL. I found that Barns & Noble had a more helpful url to link to and used that instead.",
