Beside each book is a section to describe the basic concepts of each album. I implemented a hover feature that added a box shadow, transitioned and increased the size of each photo when a cursor glides over it. If you click on the available area it will link you to the Barns and Noble online bookstore to purchase his products. ",

I struggled getting the images of the books to link properly. In the end I found it was not my code, but the URL. Experimentation and trial and error is a must.",

The gallery is formatted using flexbox, and will transition to one per line when on a smaller viewport or mobile device.",

      "troubles" => "As a second project, I found myself not needing to look up documentation as often, I had much more CSS information ingrained and was able to implement style quicker. In my process of being excited about my speed, my lack of organization was my downfall. It taught me how important it was to comment and have a system in place so I can find the right documentation.

        "discription" => "For this app when you press a button it outputs an INSPIRING random quote for you. I used an ajax function in JQuery to connect to the URL. I got the data in JSON format and placed it in my HTML code. Every time the button is clicked it resends a request getting another quote. In Addition to receiving a quote, if one is 'so worthy of your praise' you can press the twitter button. It transfers the quote through a query string to post to your twitter account.",

        "troubles" => "I was overwhelmed with all the different API's out there, some gave a list of quotes others automatically generated them. Learning the process of acquiring the keys and using them correctly in a query took the most time. Once I had the data, selecting the correct information was the downhill slide.",

      "discription" => "This app finds where you are located and displays some basic weather information about your surrounding area. It starts with getting your geolocation. Once the longitude and latitude are acquired I can use those as variables in a query string to get weather information about the area. I used FCC-weather-API to acquire the name of the city, weather in Fahrenheit and Celsius, weather conditions and an icon showing the conditions. I inputted those into the HTML. The button will toggle you back and forth between Fahrenheit and Celsius.",

      "troubles" => "With this project I have learned that finding a good database is important. I used the database FreeCodeCamp provided. They didn't want API keys in CodePen for security and privacy reasons. I got the majority of the project and found out that database did not provide all the information required (ie. city, state). Using a different database such as google maps would have provided more information needed.",

      "outcome" => "In the future, I will learn to do extra research to find the best API and information for my needs. Efficiency is a goal I have in all work I do, it makes things simple and eventually easier, even if the process leading up to that is a little messy."

During the extraction I minimized them for better load time and performance of the page. The design was then implemented by hand-coding them using CSS, HTML. JQuery was added for intractability with the individual groups of products, allowing them to toggle between being visible and being collapsed.",

      "troubles" => "Creating the page with HTML CSS and JQuery were simple. Learning Photoshop would be the lesson. At first I was extracting individual layers and trying to manually layer them with CSS. Once i learned you can extract multiple layers together it made things much easier.

This allows the user easy access to each of the houses. A form was added at the bottom. When you enter in an address it will output the latitude and longitude on screen. This is the first step to automatically placing new address as a point on the map. ",

Then geocoding and geolocation was implemented to extract the latitude/ longitude. The information was then retrieved in JSON format and placed into the Google Maps API. A marker is then dynamically places as a Tiny house is put up for sale. You can search houses based on different featured they possess. This was one of the larger personal projects i have worked on.
