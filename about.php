<p>As a self-starter in the computer science field, I have spent my free time doing online classes, tutorials, and tracks gaining knowledge of basic development languages. Improving and expanding on those skills I had the opportunity to provide web updates and data entry into various websites.
<br>
<br>
I am currently spending time working on personal projects to perfect and practice the detail orienting skills of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery. I was exposed to the world of PHP and Wordpress development and would like to dive in deeper into those topics as well. Through learning development on my own I have become conscious of soft skills such as time-management, habit forming, and self-motivation. 
<br>
<br>
Eager to learn more and gain skill sets in the development community I am planning on seeking out an internship or student position while taking on individual clients and opportunities in my free time.</p>
