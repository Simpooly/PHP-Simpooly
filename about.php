			<p>Simplicity with a quirk. As a self-starter in the computer science field, I have spent my free time doing online classes, tutorials, and tracks gaining knowledge of basic development languages. Improving and expanding on those skills I had the opportunity to provide web updates and data entry into various websites.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am currently spending time working on personal projects to perfect and practice the detail orienting skills of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery. I was exposed to the world of PHP and Wordpress development and would like to dive in deeper into those topics as well. Through learning development on my own I have become conscious of soft skills such as time-management, habit forming, and self-motivation. 'Id like to develope...skill, i would consider myself well versed at..., i am familiar with..., presentations.. preperation is where i excell, not quick on your feet, time management is about prioritizing'
